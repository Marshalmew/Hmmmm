❗️FOR MY FRIENDS, PLEASE READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH BELOW ❗️

>> Personality ➜ I have a very real social anxiety problem on ponytown (especially when it comes to people I have added)!! I’m often even afraid to interact with my own friends on ponytown due to said anxiety - even though most of the time I really do want to talk to them, but I just struggle and lack the ability to do so. SO, if I am your friend on ponytown, please don’t think I don’t want to be your friend just because I never interact with you unless you interact with me first! It’s not that I don’t like you OR find you annoying! I really DO want to talk to you, but I just can’t find the words I need to initiate anything. Very sorry. I’m also very bad at keeping up a conversation. Additionally, if we are talking and you just stop saying anything during our chat, I will most likely also stop messaging you as as I feel like you don’t want to be bothered. Please tell me when you do and don’t want to talk, as I’m very bad at recognizing those kinds of things. But despite my anxiety around people, I do find enjoyment in being able to just hang around people I feel comfortable with, and just chill doing whatever they want to do. While I do often sit afk by myself around the map, I definitely prefer being able to talk to my friends more..

>> Something extra you should know ➜ I often, very often, tend to distance myself from my friends or people I know online. I have a very very bad habit of hyper-fixating on friends that I interact with online, to the point where its become unhealthy for me. Because of this, I don’t interact much with the people I have added - and if I do, I probably feel very uncomfortable in doing so - though it is nothing against you, if you are my friend. I just get unhealthily possessive.

For other people!! ↓

>> Personality ➜ I can be weird at times, so if I’m being too weird for your liking, then PLEASE ignore me instead of being a bitch about it. Aside from me being weird, I can also get pissed off kind of easily from people I don’t know. So if you ARENT my friend and I tell you to stop doing something, then stop or I most likely will ignore you, and if you keep doing it after I ignore you, I’ll block you. If you ARE my friend and I tell you to stop doing something, I’m like 99% of the time just joking around! So if you aren’t my friend, don’t purposely be annoying towards me specifically, or I will most likely permanently block you, or until I feel like unblocking.

>> I don’t just randomly block people because I “feel like it” - TRUST ME, I am NOT one of those people who do that. If I have you blocked, I probably have you blocked for a good reason, and you will most likely stay blocked. This has not happened to me yet, but if you decide to either use an alt account or get your friend to harass me because I blocked you, then GUARANTEE you are staying blocked.

—————————————————————☆

>> Conclusion ➜ From here on out, you have been warned against interacting with me on ponytown. If you get mad because I’m cosplaying something from a fandom you don’t like, then it’s your own fault for not reading this beforehand. It is not my fault you decided to interact with me before learning what I was into, or my personality traits - because I couldn't give two fucks about what you think of me. If you don’t want me interacting with you because of my fandoms, then I won't bother you. Plain and simple. Or I'll just block you if you won't shut up about it.
